It is a Vision Transformer (yes it transforms images)
- A PyPI package for researcher to plug into their code for model training
- Performance wise optimized
- The code is inspired from https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/timm/models/vision_transformer.py

Things to look upon
- [Three things everyone should know about Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09795)
- [Comprehensive study of ViT](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.01232v1)

- Right now - for generating best embeddings faster
- embeddings for classification

Goal is to expand to Vision models
